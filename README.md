ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Trend Prediction with LSTM
ðŸ”¹ Objective

The goal of this project is to predict future stock prices based on historical data using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. We enhance the forecasting performance by integrating technical indicators such as Moving Averages and RSI.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas, Numpy â†’ data manipulation

yfinance â†’ stock data fetching

Matplotlib, Seaborn â†’ visualization

Scikit-learn â†’ preprocessing, metrics

Keras (TensorFlow backend) â†’ LSTM modeling

Streamlit â†’ interactive dashboard

# Stock Price Trend Prediction with LSTM

End-to-end project to forecast stock closing prices using Keras LSTM with indicators (SMA, RSI).

â”œâ”€ streamlit_app.py               # Optional Streamlit dashboard

```

## Quickstart (Local)
1. **Create & activate a virtual env (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebook**
   - Open `lstm_stock_forecasting.ipynb` in Jupyter/VS Code.
   - Set your `TICKER` (e.g., `AAPL` or `TCS.NS`) and run all cells.
   - Artifacts will be saved under `artifacts/` and plots under `graphs/`.

4. **Run the Streamlit dashboard (optional)**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```


## Notes
- The model predicts **next-day close** using a rolling window (default 60 days) of features.
- Try increasing `EPOCHS` and `LOOKBACK` for improved results.
- RSI and SMAs are included as features to provide trend & momentum context.
- Make sure your ticker is correct (e.g., NSE tickers like `TCS.NS`).

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for exact packages/versions.
